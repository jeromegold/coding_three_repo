# Coding Three Project

**Overview**

The aim of the project was to use machine learning tools to generate an instagram image of an "influencer" and assess whether this generated image is
close to visually realistic and potentially could be used for advertiisng/marketing purposes.

**Overall Result**

I failed in my aim. The reasons will be discussed further.

**Introduction:**

The image generator DALL-E has been in the news lately ("From Trump Nevermind babies to deep fakes: DALL-E and the ethics of AI art", The Guardian 18.6.2022). Opinions tend to vary regarding the use cases and benefit of DALL-E to society.However, it is agreed that the images are impressive ("Give this AI a few words of description and it produces a stunning image â€“ but is it art?", The Conversation, 10.6.2022).

I wondered whether image generation could be used for advertising/marketing purposes.

The aim of this project was to test this idea in the form of a generated instagram influencer.

**Background**

Image generation is one area that has benefitted from improved techniques in machine learning. Relatively recently, in 2014, the seminal paper "Generative Adversarial Nets" was published by Goodfellow et al.

Since the first description of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), the use of GANs has increased. Websites such as https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/en demonstrate what can be achieved with image generation.

One area that extensively uses images is advertising and marketing. And Instagram is a platform used by "influencers" to generate income.  

A question I asked was whether generative techniques can be used to generate Instagram images similar to those posted by influencers.

**Method**

Obtaining images from instagram
