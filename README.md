**Introduction:**

The image generator DALL-E has been in the news lately ("From Trump Nevermind babies to deep fakes: DALL-E and the ethics of AI art", The Guardian 18.6.2022). Opinions tend to vary regarding the use cases and benefit of DALL-E to society.However, it is agreed that the images are impressive ("Give this AI a few words of description and it produces a stunning image â€“ but is it art?", The Conversation, 10.6.2022).
